this is java OOP we have the object and the class
Main.java & car.java
You also find that we have the car.class and the Main.class-
*NB-code only main.java and car java the rest will appear(AUTOMATICALY)
To combine the two simply use javac
run in the cmd or gitbash-you will get sth like-*the car has accelerated
                                                *the car has started 
NB:it depends on what you have outlined to be your result
Good Luck!Enjoy ur coding
